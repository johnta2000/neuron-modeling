# neuron-modeling

This repository contains code snippets from my graduate coursework in Theoretical Neuroscience (PHYS-585) at the University of Pennsylvania. These snippets contain various techniques used to model neurons, such as linear-nonlinear modeling, spike-triggered averages, mutual information theory, direction tuning, and curve fitting through large data sets.
